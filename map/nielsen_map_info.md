# Nielsen Map Info

Goal here is to create a custom mapping visualizations for DMAs

Using this instructions: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/how-to-create-custom-map-regions
github for Nielsen TopoJson that I found: https://github.com/simzou/nielsen-dma/blob/master/nielsentopo.json?short_path=a8dedf1
Nielsen map: https://thevab.com/storage/app/media/Toolkit/DMA_Map_2019.pdf

Notes: I need to create a mapping file of Advocado dma_id to what this file uses for dma name
